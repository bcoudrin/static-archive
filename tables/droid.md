===== Droids =====
==== Additional Rules ====
Droid crafting follows the first 3 crafting steps per normal. After Step 3: Construction in completed successfully, the PC is left with a lifeless chassis. The character may proceed to Step 4: Program Directives at any point to finish the droid.

=== Step 4: Program Directives ===
This step is required to add actual intelligence to the lifeless chassis. The character chooses one of the [[rules:crafting#droid_directive_templates|Droid Directive Templates]] and makes the listed check over the amount of time required.

If the character fails, the only thing lost is the time. Step 4 may be attempted again at the next available opportunity.

If the character succeeds, the droid is brought online after the number of hours listed; every `su` on the check beyond the first reduces the time by 2 hours (to a minimum of 1). The droid is then an NPC possessing the characteristics & attributes detailed in its Chassis Template & Directive Template.

Spending `ad`, `tr`, `th`, and `de` from the Directive Programming check follows the guidelines in the [[rules:crafting#spending_droid_programming_results|Spending Droid Programming Results]] table; as with Step 3, the player first spends `ad` & `tr`, then the GM spends `th` & `de`.
