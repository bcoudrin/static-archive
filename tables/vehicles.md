====== Vehicles and Starships ======
When building a vehicle or starship, the crafter must first construct the 3 core components: Frame, Engine, Hull. For each core component, the crafter must choose a template, acquire the materials, and perform the listed checks over the time specified.

At the GM's discretion, a PC could replace one or more core components of an existing craft, using the existing vehicle's profile as the frame, and replaces the engine and/or hull with appropriate attachments, replacing the listed elements of the craft as usual. The Assembly check uses the difficulty, time, and additional costs dictated by the craft's silhouette. A character may replace an existing engine to add two HP, replace an existing hull to add 3 HP. Some craft are too precisely built to be customized in this way - the GM is the final arbiter of what may be replaced.

===== Frame Templates / Profiles =====
The skeleton of a starship/vehicle. It is treated as an inoperable ship/vehicle until specific attachments are added during Step 4: Assembly. The frame provides the craft's baseline parameters.
